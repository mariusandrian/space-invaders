# Not A Space Invader Game

## Project Demo
https://mariusandrian.github.io/space-invaders/

## Scope 
This project is to create a game solely using HTML and vanilla JS. Using the built-in canvas element in Javascript, we are able to create animation through frame-based rendering.

API is also being used to try to integrate asynchronous updates to a game. API used is https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api.

## Technology
1. Vanilla JS
2. AJAX to call DadJoke API
3. JS Canvas
4. HTML and CSS

## User Stories
### To be able to navigate and shoot
I as a user want to move my ship in the game in all four directions including diagonally and shoot towards the enemy

### To have enemies
I as a user want to have enemies appear at the top of the screen in a random manner and shoot bullets

### To have levels
I as a user want to have three levels with increasing levels of difficulty

### Win conditino
I as a user want to win the game if I manage to survive all three levels

### Lose condition
I as a user can lose if I touch the enemy ships or their bullets

### Score
I as a user want to have a scoreboard to know how many enemies I have destroyed

### Dad Joke
I as a user want to have a randomly created dad joke when I lose a game

## Difficulties and Limitations
1. Organizing the whole game without prior knowledge of game architecture leads to confusing function locations and classes
2. Allowing multiple inputs at the same time
3. Making the enemy shoot at the player

## Future updates and implementation
1. Power ups to allow player to shoot 3 bullets at the same time
2. Another enemy type
3. Music and sound effects
4. Sprites and backgrounds
